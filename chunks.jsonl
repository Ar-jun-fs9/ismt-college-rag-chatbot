We have campuses in Sunderland in the north-east of England, London and Hong Kong. In addition, we have excellent transnational partnerships with institutions in over a dozen countries across the world. I am delighted that the International School of Management and Technology (ISMT) has become our latest partner and that it will be recruiting its first intake of students studying for Sunderland degrees in October 2021. Like the University of Sunderland, ISMT has an excellent reputation and we see great benefits for students in this new arrangement. The University of Sunderland was recently shortlisted as United Kingdom University of the Year, something that speaks to the range and quality of our work. That will now be available to ISMT students in a number of places across Nepal. So, we look forward to welcoming those who will study for our degrees in subjects as diverse as computer systems engineering, business management, and tourism and hospitality. The ties of friendship between the UK and Nepal run long and deep. It is that spirit that will, undoubtedly, make the relationship between the University and Sunderland and ISMT a great success, now and in the future.

BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) is a management degree designed to build your foundation in business strategy, leadership, marketing, finance, and administration.

A BBA graduate is typically trained to work in banks, startups, NGOs, IT companies, or even government service. Many also choose the BBA route as a stepping stone to an MBA or specialized business or marketing career. What Is BHM? BHM (Bachelor of Hotel Management) is also an undergraduate degree focused on hospitality and tourism services. It combines classroom learning with practical training in hotel operations, guest relations, food and beverage management, front office management, and event handling. In Nepal, BHM is offered by colleges under Tribhuvan University, Pokhara University, Purbanchal University, and many international affiliations from varied countries. Students pursuing this course gain practical experience through training in college-operated model hotels and kitchens, as well as collaborations with hospitality businesses in Nepal and internationally. BHM graduates typically work in hotels, airlines, cruise lines, event companies, or tourism firms. The course is ideal for students who enjoy service, travel, and working with people.

You must be adaptable to new tech, evolving plans, and hectic schedules. That flexibility and resilience are huge. Business & Finance Knowledge: Beyond marketing, do you understand how a company actually makes money? Do you understand the basic financial gears that keep the engine running? That business acumen helps you make smarter decisions. Team Player & Leadership Attitude Can you genuinely collaborate with different people? And do you take initiative without being told? We love seeing someone who steps up and contributes to the collective goal. One of our BBA tutors says to our students, “Don’t stop at just attending classes. Develop real problem-solving skills, learn about the market, and intern early.” For BHM Graduates: Hospitality & Service Excellence The hospitality sector demands precision, efficiency, and genuine customer care to ensure seamless service.
