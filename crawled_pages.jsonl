We have campuses in Sunderland in the north-east of England, London and Hong Kong. In addition, we have excellent transnational partnerships with institutions in over a dozen countries across the world.\nI am delighted that the International School of Management and Technology (ISMT) has become our latest partner and that it will be recruiting its first intake of students studying for Sunderland degrees in October 2021. Like the University of Sunderland, ISMT has an excellent reputation and we see great benefits for students in this new arrangement.\nThe University of Sunderland was recently shortlisted as United Kingdom University of the Year, something that speaks to the range and quality of our work. That will now be available to ISMT students in a number of places across Nepal. So, we look forward to welcoming those who will study for our degrees in subjects as diverse as computer systems engineering, business management, and tourism and hospitality.\nThe ties of friendship between the UK and Nepal run long and deep.

Incredibly supportive lecturers, staff and classmates challenged me to discover a new version of myself I didn't know I had. It was a wonderful time in my life and the best educational experience I ever had.\nBARSHA POKHAREL\nAs I completed my plus two graduation, I was in dilemma about choosing a best college to make my future in IT. In course of searching best college & subject of my choice, I found ISMT College that offers British Degrees BBA, BSc.IT and BHM. As I was keen to study IT, I got the subject of my choice here. The most important thing about this college is that there are highly qualified teachers and the degree I achieve here is recognized across the world. Additionally, there is ample of resources such as library, E-library, computer labs and sport facilities. I am glad that I am studying at ISMT College and truly believe it helps me to grab a skill and knowledge that is necessary in coming days.\nKUSHMA BHUSAL\nTime spent at ISMT counts as period of my personal, social intellectual growth. Not only did I receive valuable knowledge I also gained an everlasting friendships, good will and socio-professional skills. The care and teaching methodologies here has shaped my knowledge and skills and piqued my habit for learning. These inspirations will always be reflected in my works and future endeavors.\nDEEPAK SUBEDI\nI must say ISMT College is the best IT College in our country. With qualified and generous teachers having real-time industry working experience, an individual caring environment, exceptionally supportive faculty staff and a committed college team creating professional standards through its education. I really found ISMT College a smart choice to study IT. What really fascinated me to study IT is its industry sought syllabus and courses. Grabbing its premium opportunity that transfers BTEC HND credits at The University of Newcastle, Australia where I am studying the final year in Bachelor of Information Technology.”\nAAKASH JOSHI\nI have finished my Master in Professional Accounting (MPA) from Australian Catholic University with a distinction from the major. Recently working here as a Marketing and Admission Manager for the Brainstorm Education Consultants based in Surry Hills, Sydney. I still remember the first insights that I got in from my respected principal Dhruba Babu Joshi “Think beyond the Box” in my orientation classes. That was simply the quote, but for me it was the turning point and real charisma that motivated me for my corporate life. I would like to appreciate all the academic professionals and support staff at ISMT for putting up all the efforts and gratitude to groom us and make us corporate professionals. Thank you ISMT for being the best to nurture me and aspire me to have a meaningful life.\nISMT College Kathmandu\n+977-1-4112122 / 4112159\nTinkune, Gairigaun, Kathmandu\n[email protected]\nISMT College Pokhara\n+977-61-433826 / 435436\nPokhara-15, Annapurna Marg, Nepal\n[email protected] click to\n                                                                    send mail\nISMT College Chitwan\n+977-56-515146\nBharatpur-12, Chitwan, Nepal\n[email protected]\nISMT College Biratnagar\n+977 021-423141 / 465231\nBiratnagar-4, Kanchanbari, Nepal\n[email protected] click to\n                                                                    send mail\nISMT College Butwal\n+977-71-437238 / 9801183808\nJanakinagar, Butwal, Nepal\n[email protected]\nLet Us Know About Your Review"}

In Nepal, it is one of the most popular degrees among +2 graduates, especially those from management or science backgrounds.\nThe program is offered by Tribhuvan University, Pokhara University, Kathmandu University, Purbanchal University, and international colleges affiliated with foreign universities.\nA BBA graduate is typically trained to work in banks, startups, NGOs, IT companies, or even government service. Many also choose the BBA route as a stepping stone to an MBA or specialized business or marketing career.\nWhat Is BHM?\nBHM (Bachelor of Hotel Management) is also an undergraduate degree focused on hospitality and tourism services. It combines classroom learning with practical training in hotel operations, guest relations, food and beverage management, front office management, and event handling.\nIn Nepal, BHM is offered by colleges under Tribhuvan University, Pokhara University, Purbanchal University, and many international affiliations from varied countries.\nStudents pursuing this course gain practical experience through training in college-operated model hotels and kitchens, as well as collaborations with hospitality businesses in Nepal and internationally.\nBHM graduates typically work in hotels, airlines, cruise lines, event companies, or tourism firms. The course is ideal for students who enjoy service, travel, and working with people.\nSimilarities of BHM and BBA\nBoth BHM and BBA are management courses. The end goal of learning any of these degrees is to operate and grow a business. This brings an overlapping list of skills, which must be taught to both BHM as well as BBA students.\nManagement: Both need to plan, organize, and lead teams/operations.\nFinance: Both require understanding budgets and financial health.\nMarketing: Both need to attract customers (guests or buyers).\nHR: Both manage people effectively.\nCustomer Focus: Both aim for satisfaction, be it guest or client.\nOperations: Both ensure smooth day-to-day processes.\nUltimately, both BHM and BBA are about making a business succeed financially and operationally. A hotel (BHM focus) is still a business that needs profit, efficient processes, and happy customers, just like any other company (BBA focus). But the difference lies in their approach, specialisation, classroom environments, and industry connections.\nSo,\nWhich is the better option, a BHM or a BBA?\nA BBA degree is a more favourable option for those interested in administrative or banking roles and are planning to pursue an MBA in future. It also builds a solid foundation for marketing and human resource management.\nBHM is great if you enjoy serving people, cooking or housekeeping. You can pursue a specialised MBA even after BHM.\nTo choose the right bachelor’s course for yourself, tilt the question from “Which degree is better?” to “Which degree is better for me, and why?”\nBBA vs BHM: Which is Better for you ?\nIf you're deciding between BBA and BHM after +2 in Nepal, it’s important to understand how these degrees differ, not just in subjects but in how they shape you and your future.\nYour decision should be based on your:\nInterests that drive you - choose the course with a similar curriculum focus\nThe skills you want to learn , even if it has complexities and require consistency\nYour eligibility for the course\nWhere you see yourself by the end of your Bachelor's; the professional outcomes you want\nThe time commitment (both courses span no less than 3-4 years )\nThe scope of the degree you choose (jobs and salaries)\nYour budget (BHM is a bit more, although the course fees largely vary by the college you choose)\nCourse Affiliation (Nepali universities, abroad studies, or an international affiliated degree in Nepal)\nWe’ll cover the major differences between BHM and BBA in this blog; the course focus, eligibility, learning style, duration, and career scope.
